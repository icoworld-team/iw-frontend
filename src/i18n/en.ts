Our main idea is to collect all ICO-market participants in one space and obtain a scale effect. Based on this effect, we are going to create services that allow users to trust each other and to provide protection from scam projects.',
    'solution.paragraph.second': 'We are creating a platform that unites many cryptocurrency investors. As a result, there will be a large turnover of investment funds appearing on our platform. Collecting small commission payments from this turnover will allow us to fully maintain the infrastructure that filters out ICO scams.',

    // Scams Protect Page
    'scams.protect': 'How are we going to offer protection from scams?',

    'scams.paragraph.first': 'The most frequent question is how we are going to offer protection from scams.',
    'scams.paragraph.second': 'The answer is below.',

    'scams.paragraph.third': 'Firstly, our goal is not to rectify the negative effects of the scam, but rather to prevent it by making it unprofitable. Our plan for doing this is as follows:',
    'scams.paragraph.third.item.first': 'Every project passes mandatory due diligence when it is being registered on our platform.',
    'scams.paragraph.third.item.second': 'We do KYC on the project founders, checking the reliability of their biographies, analyzing the project in detail, writing an audit report, and attaching it to the project profile.',
    'scams.paragraph.third.item.third': 'We communicate with every project not only online but also offline.',
    'scams.paragraph.third.item.four': 'When regulation appears, we add legal support for investments.',
    
    'scams.paragraph.four': 'This is the first level of our defense. The number of scammers will decrease by 90% because it will be impossible for them to remain anonymous. Every crypto-investor will know who took their money, and where that person is.',
    'scams.paragraph.five': 'The second level of scam protection is escrow service. We create a smart contract that sends money in tranches. For example, a project will state: "I need $10 million of investment. $1 million for the first stage, $2 million for the second, $3 million for the third, etc."',
    
    'scams.paragraph.six': 'After that:',
    'scams.paragraph.six.item.first': 'Investors\' money comes into a smart contract that we administer. Under the terms of the smart contract, we can’t take the money. We can only send it to the project or return it to the investors.',
    'scams.paragraph.six.item.second': 'We send the first tranche of investments into the project for passing the first stage.',
    'scams.paragraph.six.item.third': 'If the project fulfills its obligations at successive stages, we send the second tranche, then the third, etc.',
    'scams.paragraph.six.item.four': 'If the project doesn’t fulfill these obligations, we return the money to the investors.',
    
    'scams.paragraph.seven': 'Thus, the project doesn’t receive the full amount of money at once. It gets payment in parts after successfully passing each stage. In such a situation it becomes really unprofitable to scam. Therefore, it will scare away the remaining scammers and fully protect investors.',

    'scams.why.investors.will.trust': 'There is also the question of why investors will trust our platform',
    'scams.why.investors.will.trust.text': 'The reason is the same: it is profitable for us to be honest. Our business is a reputable one. And only if we do our job well, can we earn the trust of investors. Thereby, we will be able to attract hundreds of projects per year. We will earn big money on commissions. Very big money. However, a few simple mistakes can destroy our reputation and instantly drive away clients. We do not want to lose hundreds of good projects over a few scams. Therefore, in our case honesty is not just a question of morality, but a matter of common sense.',

    // Market Monopoly Page
    'market.monopoly': 'Market monopoly, or why are we developing a social network?',

    'market.monopoly.paragraph.first': 'Our project has two parts:',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.first.item.first': 'The business part. This includes scam protection services and asset management infrastructure. This part provides trust between the ICO market stakeholders and charges a commission for the service. This is the monetization of the project.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.first.item.second': 'The social part. This is a familiar social network that unites the participants of the ICO market. The social network provides customers with a quick and simple connection and collaboration. It is free of charge.',

    'market.monopoly.paragraph.second': 'The first point is clear. We create useful services and earn money. This is just a business and nothing more. But why are we developing a social network? Why are we delivering it free of charge?',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.third': 'The answer is simple. We are doing this to attract customers to our business solutions. The social network is a part of our marketing strategy. And it is a good part.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.four': 'Look.',

    'thomas.macaulay.quote': '“Nothing except the mint can make money without advertising.”–Thomas Macaulay',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.five': 'Generally, any business has two parts:',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.five.item.first': 'Product creation',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.five.item.second': 'Advertising',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.six': 'So, in our business, the social network is a non-trivial way of advertising. We don’t want to pay big money for marketing expenses all our lives. We are going to create and promote a popular platform once and just support it in the future.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.seven': 'A social network is a self-developing ecosystem. Existing users of the social network regularly create new content to promote their own accounts. This content improves and advertises the platform too. As a result, current users attract new users. At the same time, the holder of the platform just manages one. He can use the results of advertising. And he doesn’t have to pay for this. What could be better? Nothing. Facebook, Reddit, and Medium are successful examples of such a business model.',

    'sun.tzu.quote': '“So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong, and strike at what is weak.”–Sun Tzu',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.eight': 'A social network allows us to avoid a marketing war. We want to monopolize the ICO market and protect our positions with small forces. We have the following arguments:',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.eight.item.first': 'Today marketing wars are wars of budgets. When giants like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs or Citi come to the ICO market we will not be able to defeat them in a direct battle. So we have to find another way.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.eight.item.second': 'In this case, a social network is a more elegant solution. We are going to attract the initial audience to our platform because we are the first and we don’t have strong competitors. After that, new users will appear without our participation.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.eight.item.third': 'But most importantly, they will stay with us forever. A social network creates a strong connection between users. A potential competitor can’t recruit one at a time. He must take them all at once. The complexity of this task will increase with the growth of users. As a result, it will be impossible for even J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs or Citi.',
    'market.monopoly.paragraph.eight.item.four': 'In a long-term success case, we will have access to all ICO investors in the world through our social network.',

    'market.monopoly.paragraph.nine': 'In a long-term success case, the social network will allow us to monopolize the ICO marketplace. We will create business services and receive an inexhaustible flow of new customers. We will be able to dump competitors if necessary. At the same time, we will always remain a profitable business because of the economies of scale.',
